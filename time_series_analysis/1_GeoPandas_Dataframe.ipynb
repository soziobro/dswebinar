If you are not familiar with `pandas`, we recommend taking a quick look at its [Getting started documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html#getting-started) before proceeding.\n\nThe core data structure in GeoPandas is the `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`, a subclass of `pandas.DataFrame`, that can store geometry columns and perform spatial operations. The `geopandas.GeoSeries`, a subclass of `pandas.Series`, handles the geometries. Therefore, your `GeoDataFrame` is a combination of `pandas.Series`, with traditional data (numerical, boolean, text etc.), and `geopandas.GeoSeries`, with geometries (points, polygons etc.). You can have as many columns with geometries as you wish; there's no limit typical for desktop GIS software.\n\n![geodataframe schema](../_static/dataframe.svg)\n\nEach `GeoSeries` can contain any geometry type (you can even mix them within a single array) and has a `GeoSeries.crs` attribute, which stores information about the projection (CRS stands for Coordinate Reference System). Therefore, each `GeoSeries` in a `GeoDataFrame` can be in a different projection, allowing you to have, for example, multiple versions (different projections) of the same geometry.\n\nOnly one `GeoSeries` in a `GeoDataFrame` is considered the _active_ geometry, which means that all geometric operations applied to a `GeoDataFrame` operate on this _active_ column.\n\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\nUser Guide\n    \nSee more on [data structures in the User Guide](../docs/user_guide/data_structures.rst).\n</div>\n\n\nLet's see how some of these concepts work in practice.\n\n## Reading and writing files\n\nFirst, we need to read some data.\n\n### Reading files\n\nAssuming you have a file containing both data and geometry (e.g. GeoPackage, GeoJSON, Shapefile), you can read it using `geopandas.read_file()`, which automatically detects the filetype and creates a `GeoDataFrame`. This tutorial uses the `\"nybb\"` dataset, a map of New York boroughs, which is part of the GeoPandas installation. Therefore, we use `geopandas.datasets.get_path()` to retrieve the path to the dataset.","metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import geopandas\n\npath_to_data = geopandas.datasets.get_path(\"nybb\")\ngdf = geopandas.read_file(path_to_data)\n\ngdf","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Writing files\n\nTo write a `GeoDataFrame` back to file use `GeoDataFrame.to_file()`.

Note that `GeoDataFrame.area` is just `GeoSeries.area` applied to the _active_ geometry column.\n\nBut first, to make the results easier to read, set the names of the boroughs as the index:","metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"gdf = gdf.set_index(\"BoroName\")","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"gdf[\"area\"] = gdf.area\ngdf[\"area\"]","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Getting polygon boundary and centroid\n\nTo get the boundary of each polygon (LineString), access the `GeoDataFrame.boundary`:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"gdf['boundary'] = gdf.boundary\ngdf['boundary']","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Since we have saved boundary as a new column, we now have two geometry columns in the same `GeoDataFrame`.\n\nWe can also create new geometries, which could be, for example, a buffered version of the original one (i.e., `GeoDataFrame.buffer(10)`) or its centroid:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"gdf['centroid'] = gdf.centroid\ngdf['centroid']","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Measuring distance\n\nWe can also measure how far each centroid is from the first centroid location.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"first_point = gdf['centroid'].iloc[0]\ngdf['distance'] = gdf['centroid'].distance(first_point)\ngdf['distance']","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note that `geopandas.GeoDataFrame` is a subclass of `pandas.DataFrame`, so we have all the pandas functionality available to use on the geospatial dataset â€” we can even perform data manipulations with the attributes and geometry information together.\n\nFor example, to calculate the average of the distances measured above, access the 'distance' column and call the mean() method on it:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"gdf['distance'].mean()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Making maps\n\nGeoPandas can also plot maps, so we can check how the geometries appear in space.
